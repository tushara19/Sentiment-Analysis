"Our parents thinks we're being dramatic...
Our school thinks we're being lazy...
Our 'friends' thinks we want attention...
Our music that we listen to will listen to us too...
Our pillows that we sleep on catches our tears when no one else did...
Our bed that we lay down on lets us rest and never bothers us when others do...
Our anime or fictional characters that we love and get attached to so much knows that we love them and they love us too but we just don't know it because they don't exist...
Our mirrors that we stare at when we cry it never laughs at you and will never judge you...
Our sleep that we do every night let's us escape this cruel reality by dreaming...
The sun that always shines bright will always be the one that always greets us good morning first...
The moon that shines so bright at night will always be there saying good night and always be there if you wanna talk to them...
The air and nature let's us relax when others made us do things but we couldn't anymore...
The life that we have is trying it's best to give us the best life that we need but it always messes up but when it tried fixing it reality would keep on ruining it...
Death that we always wanted to crave for wanted us to keep going on with our lives without us trying to commit suicide but death always keeps on getting it...
The earth that we live in is trying to keep us safe from the danger that is out there...
The house that we live in is always giving us shelter so that we won't get sick...
The rain that keeps on coming is trying to calm us down...
The pets that we own is concerned for us and will always be there when you want accompany...
The food that we eat is trying to keep us alive and away from starvation...
The stuffs that we learn from school is trying to keep us educated so that we know what else is there out in the world...
The forest that we see is always there to give us oxygen that keeps us alive...
The clothes that we wear is trying to keep us clean...
The pretty flowers that we pick is just us killing other pretty and kind people...
The animals that we always find is trying to keep us away from danger themselves...
The stars that we stare at the sky at night is keeping us happy and remembering our childhood on that we always try and find shapes that it connects to...
The clock that is ticking and showing that time it is, is keeping us updated...
The news and TV that we always use is giving us info and keeping us safe away from danger...
The online friends and strangers we met online is always there for us and understands our pain...
Our sexuality is trying to tell us to be ourselves and never look down...
The world and everything is trying to keep us happy, safe and alive more than the people we knew in person...
It's funny how strangers online that we meet understands us than our parents...
Edit: I'm sorry I wasted you're time..."

"My shower doesn't make fun of my body
My pillow hold my tears
My mirror never laughs when I'm crying
My mind keeps secrets
My bed holds me

scared to die, but tired of breathing

Honestly at this point I listen to things like this while laying in bed and thinking about things like the fact 
that all the people who claim to be my friends are never there for me and how my own family doesn’t seem to care 
about me and how I can’t even find love no matter what I do and I can’t even cry when I listen to this it’s like if
 I’m just an empty shell with nothing left inside

“Life isn’t fun without a struggle in it, but some struggles lead to tragic endings.”

Whats funny is that I act all happy around my friends and at night I just break down.. I miss the old days, I didn't fake smiles..

How come parent knows when their kid is lying but not know about their own child’s anxiety and depression

“Dont cry because they are gone, smile because they were here.”

It's funny how strangers online that we meet understands us than our parents...

""It takes one minute to have a crush on someone, one hour to like someone and it takes a day to love someone but....it takes a lifetime to forget someone...""

""The saddest things is when the person who gives you the best memories becomes a memory""

""Don't cry because it end, Smile because it happens""

""Lonely is not being alone, its the feeling that no one cares""

""The people with the biggest smiles are hiding the most pain behind them""

""You don't want to end your life. You just want to get rid of the pain inside you.""

""Why are you always so quiet?""
""Because no one is ever listening to me anyway.""

When someone who makes you feel better good and happy passes away far from you and all you have good memories that the only thing you have

""You're fading away, and it's all their fault.""

""There are moment when I wish I could roll back the clock and take away all the sadness away ,But I have the feeling that if I did , The joy would be gone as well "" .

""Now I don't cry out loud , I just suffer in silence . ""

You had only seen my smile , you never know how much pain I'm carrying inside the smile :)

""When you love them you need to let them GO""

Smile is a mask
Laugh is a cover
Sleep is an escape
Life is hell"

"”if you cry, that doesn’t make you weak, that makes you a strong person who has been holding in all their pain and needed to let it all out”"
"They didnt notice you were crying
They did notice you were sad
They didn’t notice you were tired
They didn’t notice you were alone
They didn’t notice how attentive you were
They didn’t notice how sweet you actually are...
They didn’t notice how you actually try to make others smile



They did notice you failing grades
They did notice your unattractive 
They did notice the mean side of you
They did notice all your mistakes 
They did notice all you flaws
They did notice that you weren’t good enough for them.



But you stayed strong
You kept going on
You never gave up on hope
You never let then take you down
And you know they wasn’t good enough for you
And that’s what make you stronger 

Stay safe everyone ❤"
"Me in my bed listening to this and crying into my pillows, remembering I have a sibling and parents and thinking that if they knocked on my door right now they would say I was being dramatic . I’m not suicidal but not a single day have I actually been grateful that I was alive. The only thing keeping me from running away from everyone and everything is trying to keep my parents proud with good grades and smiling laughing at school loving my family at home but……sobbing into my pillows at night…"
"A message to the future generations: ""DON'T LET THIS SONG DIE""...."

But at 18 they graduated 
At 20 they found their real friends

At 26 they met the love of their life
At 27 they were married
At 29 they had kids

Nothing hurts more when you’re crying at night without making a noise and losing your breath with those silent screams of hurt.
"Imagine how many people are sitting here, crying/depressed, lying in bed, listening to these songs. At the same time, I love you all"
"Pillow: I'll catch your tears and screams when nobody else will""

"""Our life is like a piano..filled with black and white keys..black ones are pain and sorrow..and white ones are happiness...but we need both to play music"" 💯🥺☺️"
To be honest sometimes life’s tough. And even though contemplating on the past is good it hurts. Dwelling on what you can’t change is not healthy for anyone no matter how tough you think you are. This song just brings out those things the unthinkable rushes through your head and it just becomes this addicting loneliness that makes this song as powerful when your alone. Wisely I tell you that it’s good to stop sometimes to breath because as a human I understand. Let it out you know? I hope that whatever makes you hurt is not your fault and that you are able to heal. Don’t change for others because that will only hurt you. Just be you because your another great addition to our world and without you someone else wouldn’t be smiling even if you don’t see it. Have yourself a good night

"I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or years when someone likes it, I get reminded of this beautiful song ❤️"
Just think how much effort these artists put into their songs and then it's called a masterpiece loved by everyone... Hats off to these talented people who make our teenage so beautiful and memorable
"Its not just an anime.. its a teacher, its a lesson, its a motivator, and its something that helps you become who you want to be, its a booster in learning your path and if you try to tell me otherwise ill tell you thats your opinion, this is mine"

"When your happy, U enjoy the music. When ur sad, ur understand the lyrics."
I was crying while thinking about stuff I knew was gonna happen so I listened to this and I ended up listening to it on loop for an hour
This is one of the best music playlist I’ve listened as there is moving background and lyrics showing how much effort u put into these. New sub! Stay safe and keep it up!! <3
"This playlist hit me like a train, all the songs were so beautiful.

We gotta respect our pillows for catching our tears when no body else will.

"If you cry, that means someone will never live by your side when your alone😊I love this song❤💖"
"No one notice your tears

Not to see your pain behind smile"

"Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
And we'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
I can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should have told you what you meant to me, no
Guess now I pay the price
'Cause in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one that got away, no, no, no
The one that got away"
"Your skin isn't paper, don't cut it 
Your neck isn't a coat, don't hang it 
Your body isn't a book, don't judge it 
Your life isn't a movie, don't end it 
Your heart isn't a door, don't lock it 
Remember to always love yourself no matter what you come against This is not my word, I'm spreading it to the 1% and now its your turn"

 I'm Scared to all thoses voices
inside my head
They scream to hell
i cant let them win
but i am so tired
So Tired of this life
So tired to fight
I just want to let go
Close my eyes
Take a deep Breath
And sink into unconsciousness
After all
Wasnt i born to die?"

"la música  traducida  en  

   -_-  ESPAÑOL
Mi ducha no se burla de mi cuerpo.
Mi almohada contiene mis lágrimas
Mi espejo nunca se ríe cuando estoy llorando
Mi mente guarda secretos
mi cama me sostiene

asustado de morir, pero cansado de respirar

Honestamente, en este momento escucho cosas como esta mientras estoy acostado en la cama y pienso en cosas como el hecho
que todas las personas que dicen ser mis amigos nunca están ahí para mí y que a mi propia familia no parece importarle
sobre mí y cómo ni siquiera puedo encontrar el amor sin importar lo que haga y ni siquiera puedo llorar cuando escucho esto es como si
 Solo soy una cáscara vacía sin nada dentro

“La vida no es divertida sin una lucha, pero algunas luchas conducen a finales trágicos”.

Lo gracioso es que actúo feliz con mis amigos y por la noche simplemente me derrumbo... Extraño los viejos tiempos, no fingí sonrisas...

¿Cómo es que los padres saben cuando su hijo está mintiendo pero no saben acerca de la ansiedad y la depresión de su propio hijo?

“No llores porque se han ido, sonríe porque estuvieron aquí”.

Es curioso cómo los extraños en línea que conocemos nos entienden más que nuestros padres...

""Se necesita un minuto para enamorarse de alguien, una hora para gustar de alguien y se necesita un día para amar a alguien, pero... se necesita toda una vida para olvidar a alguien...""

""Lo más triste es cuando la persona que te da los mejores recuerdos se convierte en un recuerdo""

""No llores porque termina, Sonríe porque sucede""

""Soledad no es estar solo, es sentir que a nadie le importa""

""Las personas con las sonrisas más grandes esconden más dolor detrás de ellas""

""No quieres terminar con tu vida. Solo quieres deshacerte del dolor dentro de ti"".

""¿Por qué siempre estás tan callado?""
""Porque nadie me está escuchando de todos modos"".

Cuando alguien que te hace sentir mejor bien y feliz se muere lejos de ti y todo te queda buenos recuerdos que lo unico que tienes

""Te estás desvaneciendo, y todo es culpa de ellos"".

""Hay momentos en los que desearía poder hacer retroceder el reloj y quitarme toda la tristeza, pero tengo la sensación de que si lo hiciera, la alegría también se iría"".

""Ahora no lloro en voz alta, solo sufro en silencio"".

Solo habías visto mi sonrisa, nunca sabes cuánto dolor llevo dentro de la sonrisa :)

""Cuando los amas, debes dejarlos IR""

La sonrisa es una máscara.
La risa es una tapadera
El sueño es un escape
la vida es un infierno"

"00:00 Love is gone
Don't go tonight
stay here one more time
Remine me what it's like
And let's fall in love one more time
I need you now by my side
It tears me up when you turn me down
I'm begging please, just stick around
I'm sorry, don't leave me
I want you here with me
I know that your love is gone
I can't breathe
I'm so weak
I know this isn't easy
Don't tell me taht your love is gone
That your love is gone
Don't tell me that your love is gone
That your love is gone
I'm sorry, don't leave me
I want you here with me
I know that your love is gone
I can't breathe
I'm so weak
I know this isn't easy
Don't tell me taht your love is gone
That your love is gone
That your love is gone
I can't breathe
I'm so weak
I know this isn't easy
Don't tell me taht your love is gone
That your love is gone"

I love this song
I listen to this after every breakup
"The first song made me tear up. 
My mind is soo messed up right now that I don't know what to do. I created my place in her heart. And then I destroyed it with my own hands. She gave me chances. Lots of. But my damn ego just won't let me accept it. I lied to her about lots of things. She knew I was lying. She asked me about it. But again this ego made me never accept it. I went as far as to end our relation with her. I regret every moment of it. After months of regret and depression. Yesterday night at 12 am i texted her. And she instantly called me back. I asked her to forgive me. I asked her to give me a chance. That I'll change. And that I won't lie about anything to her. She said you destroyed whatever was between us yourself. I gave you chances. But you were to stubborn to admit that you were wrong. Now you can't have any expectations from me. I know she is right. But I really regret it. I really want everything to go back as it was. But I don't know if its possible. She said that I'll think about it and answer you in 3 to 4 days. But I'm afraid that she'll say no. If she did. 😅. Then what should I do?"

Let's fight sorrow together. In love. ❤"

Some summers will never freeze,
And some things will only live in poems. 
Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart, There are memories that time does not erase... Forever does not make loss forgettable, only bearable.. The past beats inside me like a second heart. Now that I have opened that bottle of memories they're pouring out like wine, crimson and bittersweet.”"

"Dear person whoever reads this, 
Hey, you, yes, I am talking right to you. I hope you will see yourself with the eyes I see you one day, because I can tell you have some awesome music taste :) You’re such a beautiful human being and worth and enough. 
I hope you know that you do only need yourself to be happy, I know society build up the standard that whenever you’re alone you’re not living a happy live. But in fact that is not true, if you start to realize that you actually deserve all the good things happening to you, you will treat yourself a lot  nicer. I hope you let yourself rest, don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes, over regret, and over everything your mind wants to destroy you.
 I wish I could remove all those demons inside of your head because you deserve to feel happy. If you ever feel lonely then watch the sky, because you know, someone, at the same time is watching the sky too, maybe feeling the same way..I am glad you exist and I hope you won’t ever remove your own spot in this world, maybe you don’t feel like you belong here but, Angel, then build your home here. I don’t want you to leave this world unhappy.
 I want you to live every little second, I want you to feel alive, I don’t want you to see yourself just existing. You deserve it. Whatever happened, it’s not your fault, the demons in your head recognize that you have a beautiful heart, they want to take it because they have never seen such beautiful heart as yours, so why let them win over you? . You’re not selfish for isolating yourself, but you deserve to talk to someone. If you’re reading this than please never forget to breath and smile. 

Don’t live up to other standards! It’s your story and not theirs. 



Life for those who couldn’t, smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug like its your last one. 

I love you and send you hugs.

You’re so strong, you’re still here, and I am proud of you. 


YOU ARE NOT USELESS. READ THAT AGAIN. 
YOU ARE WORTH IT. READ THAT AGAIN.
YOU ARE LOVED. READ THAT AGAIN.
I AM GLAD YOU EXIST. READ THAT AGAIN.
YOU ARE NOT A PROBLEM. YOU ARE HUMAN AND YOUR FEELINGS ARE VALID. READ THAT AGAIN.
YOU ARE NOT BEING DRAMATIC. 


You’re not a burden to anyone, don’t be afraid to talk, to use your voice. 

You’re beautiful inside out. Your body is beautiful the way it is. 

Please don’t starve yourself. Please eat, I know it’s hard but you deserve food. You deserve to eat and drink. 


I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. READ THAT AGAIN.

I WISH I COULD HUGH YOU RIGHT NOW, SO A VIRTUAL HUG WILL DO. 


It hurts me to see you’re in pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you. 


I love u I love u I love u I love u I love u please don’t go.


I am sorry that no one is hearing you, I am sorry no one is noticing that you have lost yourself. I wish I could take your pain away, it hurts me to see the pain in your eyes.  I love you trough my words and I mean it. I just want you to stay, hold on a little longer okay? Please? For me.??

I hope you have an awesome day/ morning/ evening/ night. 

If it’s night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. 


If it’s day for you, don’t start it by such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water in the morning and so on.. You will start building little healthy habits. 


If it’s evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed.
And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re stronger than you think, I know you will make it :) 


Now wipe those tears away and smile for me, you really don’t know much a smile can brighten someone’s day, do you? I hope one day yours will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore, because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.


Remember crying is not weakness, let it out as much as you can but don’t let the emotion control you by giving up. It’s okay, you’re here, you’re safe, you can let it out.

Did anyone asked you, how you are feeling today? If not, how are you really? I don’t think you’re doing good, but you will feel good at one point. Don’t give yourself up. 

I am sorry you feel misunderstood.


But anyone who gets to be with you, doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they is :).

Enough with beating up yourself for today, okay?!

- The stranger that cares about you more than anything.

I hope this is enough for you to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. I hope you can stay.


This is your sign to stay and treat yourself with love, you deserve it.

And in case no one told you today, again, I am so proud of you. 


I hope you will remember my words-

Until tomorrow, my friend :
This text is from another person."
Im too tired of crying but i never tired of smiling n laughing 🙃
Diese Musik ist das besste ich höre es immer es ist beruhigend  ♥️
Every now and then when I'm feeling sad I come to this song and comment's on here always make me cry.
"What anime are these in the video???? 
I have been trying to figure it out all night!
Also, thanks for the amazing playlist!! It rlly helps with what I'm going through..."
"Every human walk around with a certain kind of sadness. They may not wear it on the sleeves, but its there if you look deep❤️❤️"
"hey, you.
how old are you?
you've lived for that many years now? 
that's amazing.
why give up? you've come this far.
is it because you're tired?
don't worry
i am, too.
see?
there are people facing the same situation as you.
you're not suffering alone. 
we all are.
however, it doesn't have to be that way forever.
you still have decades more to grow, find a ray of hope and hold onto it for as long as you can.
it doesn't have to end in pain.
get up and tell yourself that there's something or someone out there waiting for you.
don't keep them waiting.
love you lots, stranger <3"
Its presence is like a nail pulled out of a wall. It's gone but it leaves an imprint :)
i love the music <3

"My shower doesn't make fun of my body
My pillow hold my tears
My mirror never laughs when I'm crying
My mind keeps secrets
My bed holds me

scared to die, but tired of breathing

Honestly at this point I listen to things like this while laying in bed and thinking about things like the fact 
that all the people who claim to be my friends are never there for me and how my own family doesn’t seem to care 
about me and how I can’t even find love no matter what I do and I can’t even cry when I listen to this it’s like if
 I’m just an empty shell with nothing left inside

“Life isn’t fun without a struggle in it, but some struggles lead to tragic endings.”

Whats funny is that I act all happy around my friends and at night I just break down.. I miss the old days, I didn't fake smiles..

How come parent knows when their kid is lying but not know about their own child’s anxiety and depression

“Dont cry because they are gone, smile because they were here.”

It's funny how strangers online that we meet understands us than our parents...

""You don't want to end your life. You just want to get rid of the pain inside you.""

""Why are you always so quiet?""
""Because no one is ever listening to me anyway.""

When someone who makes you feel better good and happy passes away far from you and all you have good memories that the only thing you have

""You're fading away, and it's all their fault.""

""There are moment when I wish I could roll back the clock and take away all the sadness away ,But I have the feeling that if I did , The joy would be gone as well "" .

Our favorite  songs are the ones that tell the saddest thoughts
Some times happy memories hurt the most..🙂🥺
My fav.playlist..it makes my day
"Parents: You can talk to us 
Me: opens up to them
Them: Youre being too dramatic.
Damn. Online strangers are just better when it comes to comforting even tho you dont know them that much.

i love this song!!!!😭😭😭
To be honest I’m not waiting for a happy ending anymore I’m just waiting for the end 💔😔
"This feels so comfortable, like everyone in the comments are all having a big sleepover together"
"It's sad that every beat of my heart still tightens at the thought of you, the thought of your bewitching lies slowly enrapturing me in your arms, the thought of your alluring whispers fibbing millions of promises. It's sad that you had to use the most sincere truth to deceive me, that you had to break our mirage of illusions into unrepairable pieces. It's sad how much my soul ached behind this emotionless wall I had to build so I don't see myself getting weaker, as I'm watching you fade away.
It's sad that I can still remember the way we used to pretend, while I was absorbed in the false truth you made me believe in. You made me feel like I was living for the second time, like a child, you made me overflow with the desire to rediscover this world that seemed so perpetual.
I sometimes wonder, why was I always so fearful? Always startled in anxiety for fear that one day I will no longer have you, as if I already knew... But was I really clueless? 
I sometimes wonder if all these memories are nothing but past wounds that I thought you healed. I sometimes still imagine holding your hand tightly, holding you in my arms like it's our last embrace. I wish it didn't end there. And what if it wasn't over yet? What if I was still living within these warm delusions you created for me? I wish that road had no destination so that I wouldn't have lost you again. I sometimes wish I could cross your path once again, start our story over as if we had never met before, rewrite it again, and give it a better ending, if any.

"I’ve had a tough day. I know it’s stupid to be sad, but I need to get it out. 
I don’t belong anywhere, I’m no one’s favourite but a mere passing thought for most. Everyone comes to me for advise, for a shoulder to cry on, for help fixing their problems…but why is it that I feel so alone and drained. Everyone wants something from me, but the moment I need someone to be by my side there’s no one. 
My friends always see me smile and laugh, but never see the tears I’ve wiped before seeing them, the constant thought that I’m a nuisance and how I’m the least close with them all. I see their videos and photos of when I’m not there and they just seem more closer and better off without me. 
My family don’t even have my pictures around the house, they say it’s because they haven’t got one…yeah that’s because I’m the one always taking the picture of them, rarely in them myself. I called my family this morning, they said nothing was going on …yet a few hours later they all went to have a fancy bbq and I only found out through social media. of course I’m left out. 
My mother only brags about my grades, but never shows me off to her friends, just my sisters and brothers. I’m not her daughter when she introduces me, I’m introduced as a mere relative. 
I’ve grown tired of life at this point…"

Songs are just medicine for pain 🖤
I really need a satifying song when my heart is gone like now
I listen this music because with my future wife I have a problem 💔🖤😔
"Recently, I find it so hard to cry. I used to cry all the time, so easily but recently, I suppressed my emotions so much cause I didn’t  want to deal with them that I rarely cry or feel. But then, occasionally, I read or see something that really speaks to me, and I burst into tears. I read a comment saying about how a teachers told a student how they were still beautiful regardless of their self harm scars, a comment that spoke about the events that occurred after one suicided and how much everyone actually loved that person, and I suddenly feel this overwhelming amount of emotions that I didn’t even know I had and I start crying."
This is the best playlist ever
who is tired of their life but isn't ready to die?
I love this song so much I always
You know when a person is insecure its not because he's scared to see their loved one with someone else its because he's scared he might be alone forever
"I recall when i was at the middle of the night crying and asking for help, i cried a lot but in silence.  I relapse and i hope stay asleep for much time, ty for your playlist."

"Maybe I am here with the same or different intentions as you guys, hearing sad songs to unlock the kept pain and sadness locked and put away in the heart. But sometimes you have to let it all out you know? Doesn't mean you're crying means you're weak, it just means that you were strong enough to carry your burdens and needed to take a break from the load. I may not understand how you are feeling right now, but hope this makes your day better."
For me being depressed is living in some of your past moments where if you would have done something different that you would become too perfect in everyone else's eyes
honestly this song make me cry but it heal my soul thanks you so much
the lyrics is very emotional
how can you lose your bff so fast like how ed hurts real bad there's nothing you can do if she does it first
Crying doesn't mean weak..we have to happy to leave someone who don't love us.. that's achievement..it will give us time to find someone who loves us..stop crying for the one who dont love us..be strong 💪 ❤
IM BORED AT THIS SONG BUT ITS NICE

I’ve never cared about what does a songs means but now after my bf broke up with me I started to care really much about their meanings

"When I'm at school : Haha that's hilarious!!!
When I'm on the bus : Haha, hey want to come over today,
When I'm in my room drawing : ""listening to music"" 
When I'm in my room about to go to sleep : Crying, ""thinking about loved ones who have passed""
I hold a fake smile when i'm at school,  at home, at special occasions, and it's not healthy.
""When I'm at school i try to hold in my tears so I don't cry in front of everyone, but truth is I feel like crying,
But I hold in my tears so when my friends cry I can comfort them and support them with what happened, If I do cry I hide it, 
I smile and laugh but that dosn't mean I'm happy, 
I could be smiling but you don't know how much I want to start to break out crying and how much pain there is in that smile,
Nothing hurts more when you’re crying before you go to sleep without making a noise and losing your breath with those silent screams of hurt.
Note to everyone : Try to be brave NOT to act cool but to be brave for the other people around you, You are stong you are kind and you are special.
Don't hold in your tears, Be happy that you have a life and live your life with happines not sadness.
I don't know who you are but i know you are beutiful and smart.
Forget all the sad thoughts.
Forget all the bad thoughts.
 I know that some people go through things or are sad a lot for multiple different reasons.
How come parent knows when their kid is lying but not know about their own child’s anxiety and depression.

You have made at least one person in this world smile, 

You have made at least one person in this world happy,
Whatever you are going through, You will get through it.
COME ON GET UP, KEEP TRYING, YOU CAN DO THIS, ALMOST THERE, SO CLOSE, YOU'VE GOT THIS!!!!!!!!
LET""S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
you did it,
Whatever your sad thoughts are.......................BLOCK THOSE SAD THOUGHT'S OUT
Those sad thoughts don't deserve to be here.
When a sad thought comes to your mind, Say GO AWAY!!!
SOOOO MANY PEOPLE LOVE YOU.!!!!!!!!
YOU ARE AMAZING AND KIND AND AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Have a great day.!.!

"Our parents thinks we're being dramatic...
Our school thinks we're being lazy...
Our 'friends' thinks we want attention...
Our music that we listen to will listen to us too...
Our pillows that we sleep on catches our tears when no one else did...
Our bed that we lay down on lets us rest and never bothers us when others do...
Our anime or fictional characters that we love and get attached to so much knows that we love them and they love us too but we just don't know it because they don't exist...
Our mirrors that we stare at when we cry it never laughs at you and will never judge you...
Our sleep that we do every night let's us escape this cruel reality by dreaming...
The sun that always shines bright will always be the one that always greets us good morning first...
The moon that shines so bright at night will always be there saying good night and always be there if you wanna talk to them...
The air and nature let's us relax when others made us do things but we couldn't anymore...
The life that we have is trying it's best to give us the best life that we need but it always messes up but when it tried fixing it reality would keep on ruining it...
Death that we always wanted to crave for wanted us to keep going on with our lives without us trying to commit suicide but death always keeps on getting it...
The earth that we live in is trying to keep us safe from the danger that is out there...
The house that we live in is always giving us shelter so that we won't get sick...
The rain that keeps on coming is trying to calm us down...
The pets that we own is concerned for us and will always be there when you want accompany...
The food that we eat is trying to keep us alive and away from starvation...
The stuffs that we learn from school is trying to keep us educated so that we know what else is there out in the world...
The forest that we see is always there to give us oxygen that keeps us alive...
The clothes that we wear is trying to keep us clean...
The pretty flowers that we pick is just us killing other pretty and kind people...
The animals that we always find is trying to keep us away from danger themselves...
The stars that we stare at the sky at night is keeping us happy and remembering our childhood on that we always try and find shapes that it connects to...
The clock that is ticking and showing that time it is, is keeping us updated...
The news and TV that we always use is giving us info and keeping us safe away from danger...
The online friends and strangers we met online is always there for us and understands our pain...
Our sexuality is trying to tell us to be ourselves and never look down...
The world and everything is trying to keep us happy, safe and alive more than the people we knew in person...
It's funny how strangers online that we meet understands us than our parents...
Edit: I'm sorry I wasted you're time..."
I'm here to take away my pain.

"""Just because I can take pain dosent mean I deserve it""
-Unknown"
"to the person reading this, 
It’s been hard for you, I know, and it makes me sad that you don’t see yourself in the way I see you. Sometimes they are things in life that cause us to lose ourselves, and the way you have is so unimaginably painful. I miss your smile, the way your eyes light up the whole room just by the sound of your laughter. I miss the way you accepted the way you look in the mirror without cursing yourself out about how ugly you look. I miss the way you didn’t think of yourself as a failure because everyone makes mistakes, we all have flaws and we all aren’t perfect. It’s painful to see that no one around you seems to see the pain through your eyes, but, stranger, I do, I see how heavy your heart is and how comforting the sadness for you might be, how afraid your heart is of happiness because it disappears in the end, right? You don’t know how much impact you have in this world and it’s sad to see that your demons fight against you and want to take over you. Because you do make change, it’s something so simple and little that brightens up someone’s whole world, it can be a small smile from your lips, the way you look at things you’re passionate about, the way you make yourself eat even though it’s been hard for you lately, the way you zoom out and go in your own world, you brighten up my world by reading this, it means a lot to me that you’re here, existing, but I don’t want you to just exist, you deserve to feel alive. You deserve to get up in the morning and feel good about yourself. You deserve to feel something- to feel every damn second alive in this lifetime. It’s heartbreaking that you think you’re not capable of being loved, because you are, I love you through all my words and I hope you let it happen in your heart. Love is scary, I know, maybe your heart has been broken once and since then you wanted to be rather numb than feel ever again, it hurts me how you punish yourself, does it not deserve love? Because YOU DO deserve love, please forgive yourself, it’s not your fault that the demons want to take over your beautiful heart. You’re not a bad person for distancing yourself from others, but you deserve someone to talk to, you deserve someone to listen to. I am listening, you can tell me what’s wrong. It’s everything, isn’t it? There’s something pulling your heartstrings on the ground and no one seems to understand how misunderstood you feel. It's heartbreaking to know that I am behind the screen and can’t give you a hug, that’s why I will give you a big warm virtual hug and send you lots of love :). You matter. You are worthy. You are loved. You deserve good things. You deserve someone to listen to. You deserve to eat and drink. You deserve to feel good and alive. You deserve to smile. You deserve a hug. You deserve to be all the things you want to be, because you deserve to have and feel good things happening to you and have a fulfilled life. I know I might not know you personally but I care about you so much. I write this because I want you to stay here with me. I want you to hold on a little longer because you matter so much to me, because I will not let you give up on yourself. I want you to see that you should not give up on yourself because you DESERVE GOOD THINGS. I want you to look back on the time when you were a kid, you didn’t give up when you tried to swim for the first time, you didn’t give up when you tired to walk for the first time and fell, you never gave up on yourself, you always kept on pushing forwards, so why can’t you now? I know it’s tiring, you're mentally tired, but don't your younger self deserve good things? look back at your eyes that used to be full of hope, look back on those dreams. Don’t let yourself fall, you deserve better. We will both fight, I will fight for you. I won’t let those demons get to you. You can hold on to me, I won’t let you down :). Whenever you feel lonely, then look at the sky, I always look at it and think about you. Yes, you, because it makes me happy that there’s someone looking right back, maybe we can’t see each other but I can feel your presence here with me and that’s enough for me, because I am glad your heart is beating and you’re still fighting. You’re so much stronger than you think, you didn’t leave your spot on this earth even if you wanted to, you belong here, even though it doesn’t feel like it, when you don’t feel like belonging then build your own home here, put all your love in it and dreams. Think of you as a star when you feel alone, you shine because your heart is good, no matter what mistake you made, no matter about the past you had, you’re one of the stars that shine bright in the universe because you’re heart is beautiful, that’s why the demons in your mind wants to have it. As one of the stars you see other stars, maybe they have felt the same way as you do at some point in their life, but they lighten up the universe with each other’s presence. You’re a star for me, maybe you don’t see it yourself but I can see it, you’re beautiful from inside and out, your body is beautiful the way it is. You make me happy by reading this, you make me feel something by your presence and when you can make me feel that way then you also make other people feel that way about you too. I hope you stay for yourself and don’t let your story get written by others but by yourself, it’s your story not theirs. As you can see, I say a lot of “I hope” because I have hope for you even if you don’t have it for yourself, I see hope in you even though you might want to give up. That’s why I hope you won’t see the world in darkness and will see it colorful again. I hope I will give you a glimpse of hope and make the world you see a bit colorful for today. My favorite color is yellow, and I hope the next time you see the color yellow you will think about my words. If someone left you then don’t blame yourself, don’t think you weren’t enough, don’t lower yourself for someone who couldn’t see the awesomeness in you. If you lost someone I am so sorry for your loss, they want you happy. I hope you don’t feel guilty or regret because you were there, you spent enough time with them, they want you to be happy. They are in a good and safe place now. If someone broke your heart then I am so sorry that they couldn’t see the way you look so beautiful because of the heart you have. Anyone who gets to be with you, doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they is :). If you aren’t accepted at home or in general then I am so sorry that you have to deal with someone/ something you shouldn’t be ashamed of. I accept you and support you. I accept you as a human being no matter what race, religion, nationality, skin color, or sexuality you have. You’re safe here with me :). You’re not useless, you’re not a burden to anyone. You’re not a problem, you’re human and your feelings are valid. You’re not being dramatic. Please don’t starve yourself, you deserve food and to drink, I know it’s hard. It hurts to see that you’re in so much pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you. I am sorry no one is noticing, I wish /hope I could take your pain away for today or even for a moment while you’re reading this. If no one told you, I am so proud of you, you’re reading this and it’s enough for me to be proud of you because you’re here and that’s all that matters to me. If it’s night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. If it’s day for you, don’t start it with such sad music. I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such a mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water everyday in the morning and so on.. You will start building little healthy habits. If it’s evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re so strong for breathing despite the pain, I know you will make it :) I believe in you. All I want for you is to stay here, I really mean all my words, even if there are a lot of unsaid things I want to tell you and my text is getting longer and longer,I want you here. I hope one day your smile will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore, because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world. You can let go for today, I got you, you can cry your heart out as much as you want, but don’t let it tear you down and let your emotions control you by giving up. Crying is not a weakness. If you still feel alone I dedicate a song as your friend. “Dusk till Dawn- Zayn feat. Sia (I prefer the slow version)” I hope you can think of me and will remind yourself of my words, I will for sure think of you. In case no one told you and you’re unsure yourself, you’re a good person and I am so happy you’re here. I hope this is enough to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. Enough with beating yourself up for today, okay? Life for those who couldn’t, smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug like it's your last one. If you read all of it, until tomorrow my friend :)"
Came here just to cry my heart out🥺💔✋🏻
"most of the time no one will notice how sad you are until that sadness becomes anger, then you're the bad guy"
Everything heals. Your body heals. Your heart heals. The mind heals. Wounds heal. Your soul repairs itself. Your happiness is always going to come back. Bad times don’t last.. Bad times don't last... Keep moving forward until you live with the pain. Until no more pain.
I love it from France 🥰💜🥺💖🇫🇷👉👈

bro ive been crying for last few years without xxxtentacion and this songs make me cry more
"Broken on the inside:( Fake smile when I'm around people trying to be the perfect daughter but at the end of the day, I realize I'm not perfect and never will be perfect, when I'm bye myself I fall to the ground and cry so much that I sometime wish i was never born. times I'm the happiest is when I'm bye myself drawing :):( is life fake?? my teddy bears holds my tears when I'm crying on them they are the only things that comfort me the most, humans just laugh at me ,calls me names, what if I fall asleep and never wakes up ??? will I be happier when I'm dead :) i wish all the pain can go away so i will never have to hurt again :)"
I'm crying for this song thx for this :(
You woke me up from my past
"My mother asked me why I was crying, I told her ""I watched a sad scene"" but in reality, I'm crying because of her."

"Sometimes this thought wonders in my head...
is it wrong to keep someone inside your heart? Even tho you failed the relationships...
Is it wrong to be loyal for someone? Even tho they dont want you anymore and think that you're possesive?
Why cant I let go....?"
I feel like I listen to this because nobody will understand how I feel
Me recuerda a mis recuerdos de amor esta cancion tan bonita aunque  no sabes lo que dise en ingles 😫🤕😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😬😭😭😭😭😭😭

"Me gusta mucho estas músicas. Me duele tanto. Aunque no entienda el inglés jj. Estoy muy mal de salud y no me siento nada bien, tengo mucho miedo y estoy muy desesperada por mi salud.

Tampoco me rendiré hasta el último momento. Así que tu tampoco debes de hacerlo."
"My shower doesn't make fun of my body
My pillow hold my tears
My mirror never laughs when I'm crying
My mind keeps secrets
My bed holds me

scared to die, but tired of breathing

Honestly at this point I listen to things like this while laying in bed and thinking about things like the fact 
that all the people who claim to be my friends are never there for me and how my own family doesn’t seem to care 
about me and how I can’t even find love no matter what I do and I can’t even cry when I listen to this it’s like if
 I’m just an empty shell with nothing left inside

“Life isn’t fun without a struggle in it, but some struggles lead to tragic endings.”

Whats funny is that I act all happy around my friends and at night I just break down.. I miss the old days, I didn't fake smiles..

How come parent knows when their kid is lying but not know about their own child’s anxiety and depression

“Dont cry because they are gone, smile because they were here.”

It's funny how strangers online that we meet understands us than our parents...

""It takes one minute to have a crush on someone, one hour to like someone and it takes a day to love someone but....it takes a lifetime to forget someone...""

""Don't cry because it end, Smile because it happens""

""Lonely is not being alone, its the feeling that no one cares""

""The people with the biggest smiles are hiding the most pain behind them""

""You don't want to end your life. You just want to get rid of the pain inside you.""

""Why are you always so quiet?""
""Because no one is ever listening to me anyway.""

When someone who makes you feel better good and happy passes away far from you and all you have good memories that the only thing you have

""You're fading away, and it's all their fault.""

""There are moment when I wish I could roll back the clock and take away all the sadness away ,But I have the feeling that if I did , The joy would be gone as well "" .

""Now I don't cry out loud , I just suffer in silence . ""

You had only seen my smile , you never know how much pain I'm carrying inside the smile :)

""When you love them you need to let them GO""

Smile is a mask
Laugh is a cover
Sleep is an escape
Life is hell"
"Sometimes I think that:""Maybe I was born to be sad?"""
Some time we really want to scream cry get off from all the pain but we can't do this just bcz we are helpless /oppressed... We just want silence and loneliness.... But indeed our Allah is always with us... Thank to Allah for healing me through this 🙏🙏❤️❤️

"to the person reading this,

It’s been hard for you, I know, and it makes me sad that you don’t see yourself in the way I see you. Sometimes they are things in life that cause us to lose ourselves, and the way you have is so unimaginable painful. I miss your smile, the way your eyes light up the whole room just by the sound of your laughter. I miss the way you accepted the way you look in the mirror without cursing yourself out about how ugly you look. I miss the way you didn’t think of yourself as a failure because everyone makes mistakes, we all have flaws and we all aren’t perfect. It’s painful to see that no one around you seems to see the pain through your eyes, but, stranger, I do, I see how heavy your heart is and how comforting the sadness for you might be, how afraid your heart is of happiness because it disappears in the end, right? You don’t know how much impact you have in this world and it’s sad to see that your demons fight against you and want to take over you. Because you do make a change, it’s something so simple and little that brightens up someone’s whole world, it can be a small smile from your lips, the way you look at things you’re passionate about, the way you make yourself eat even though it’s been hard for you lately, the way you zoom out and go in your own world, you brighten up my world by reading this, it means a lot to me that you’re here, existing, but I don’t want you to just exist, you deserve to feel alive. You deserve to get up in the morning and feel good about yourself. You deserve to feel something- to feel every damn second alive in this lifetime. It’s heartbreaking that you think you’re not capable of being loved because you are, I love you through all my words and I hope you let it happen in your heart. Love is scary, I know, maybe your heart had been broken once and since then you wanted to be rather numb than feel ever again, it hurts me how you punish yourself, does it not deserve love? Because YOU DO deserve love, please forgive yourself, it’s not your fault that the demons want to take over your beautiful heart. You’re not a bad person for distancing yourself from others, but you deserve someone to talk to, you deserve someone to listen. I am listening, you can tell me what’s wrong. It’s everything, isn’t it? There’s something pulling your heartstrings on the ground and no one seems to understand how misunderstood you feel, it’s heartbreaking to know that I am behind the screen and can’t give you a hug, that’s why I will give you a big warm virtual hug and send you lots of love :). You matter. You are worthy. You are loved. You deserve good things. You deserve someone to listen. You deserve to eat and drink. You deserve to feel good and alive. You deserve to smile. You deserve a hug. You deserve to be all the things you want to be because you deserve to have and feel good things happening to you and have a fulfilled life. I know I might not know you personally but I care about you so much, I write this because I want you to stay here with me, I want you to hold on a little longer because you matter so much to me, because I will not let you give up on yourself. I want you to see that you should not give up on yourself because you DESERVE GOOD THINGS. I want you to look back on the time when you were a kid, you didn’t give up when you tried to swim for the first time, you didn’t give up when you tried to walk for the first time and fell, you never gave up on yourself, you always kept on pushing forwards, so why can’t you now? I know it’s tiring, your mentally tired, but don't your younger self deserve good things? look back at your eyes that used to be full of hope, look back on those dreams. Don’t let yourself fall, you deserve better. We will both fight, I will fight for you. I won’t let those demons get to you. You can hold on to me, I won’t let you down :). Whenever you feel lonely, then look at the sky, I always look at it and think about you. Yes, you, because it makes me happy that there’s someone looking right back, maybe we can’t see each other but I can feel your presence here with me and that’s enough for me because I am glad your heart is beating and you’re still fighting. You’re so much stronger thank you think, you didn’t leave your spot on this earth even if you wanted to, you belong here, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you don’t feel like belonging then build your own home here, put all your love in it and dreams. Think of you as a star when you feel alone, you shine because your heart is good, no matter what mistake you made, no matter about the past you had, you’re one of the stars that shine bright in the universe because you’re heart is beautiful, that’s why the demons in your mind want to have it. As one of the stars you see other stars, maybe they have felt the same way as you do at some point in their life, but they lighten up the universe with each other’s presence. You’re a star for me, maybe you don’t see it yourself but I can see it, you’re beautiful from inside and out, your body is beautiful the way it is. You make me happy by reading this, you make me feel something by your presence, and when you can make me feel that way then you also make other people feel that way about you too. I hope you stay for yourself and don’t let your story get written by others but by yourself, it’s your story, not theirs. As you can see, I say a lot of “I hope” because I have hope for you even if you don’t have it for yourself, I see hope in you even though you might want to give up. That’s why I hope you won’t see the world in darkness and will see it colorful again, I hope I will give you a glimpse of hope and make the world you see a bit colorful for today. My favorite color is yellow, and I hope the next time you see the color yellow you will think about my words. If someone left you then don’t blame yourself, don’t think you weren’t enough, don’t lower yourself for someone who couldn’t see the awesomeness in you. If you lost someone I am so sorry for your loss, they want you happy, I hope you don’t feel guilty or regret because you were there, you spend enough time with them, they want you to be happy. They are in a good and safe place now. If someone broke your heart then I am so sorry that they couldn’t see the way you look so beautiful because of the heart you have. Anyone who gets to be with you doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they are :). If you aren’t accepted at home or in general then I am so sorry that you have to deal with someone/ something you shouldn’t be ashamed of, I accept you and support you, I accept you as a human being no matter what race, religion, nationality, skin color, or sexuality you have. You’re safe here with me :). You’re not useless, you’re not a burden to anyone. You’re not a problem, you’re human and your feelings are valid. You’re not being dramatic. Please don’t starve yourself, you deserve food and to drink, I know it’s hard. It hurts to see that you’re in so much pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you.  I am sorry no one is noticing, I wish /hope I could take your pain away for today or even for a moment while you’re reading this. If no one told you, I am so proud of you, you’re reading this and it’s enough for me to be proud of you because you’re here and that’s all that matters to me. If it’s the night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. If it’s the day for you, don’t start it with such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such a mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water every day in the morning, and so on. You will start building little healthy habits. If it’s the evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course, you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self-care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. 
And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re so strong for breathing despite the pain, I know you will make it :) I believe in you. All I want for you is to stay here, I really mean all my words, even if there is a lot of unsaid things I want to tell u and my text is getting longer and longer, I want you here. 

I hope one day your smile will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.

You can let go for today, I got you, you can cry your heart out as much as you want, but don’t let it tear you down and let your emotions control you by giving up. Crying is not a weakness. If you still feel alone I dedicate you to a song as your friend.
“Dusk till Dawn- Zayn feat. Sia (I prefer the slow version)” I hope you can think of me and will remind yourself of my words, I will for sure think of you. 

In case no one told you and you’re unsure yourself, you’re a good person and I am so happy you’re here. 

I hope this is enough to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. Enough with beating yourself up for today, okay? 

Life for those who couldn’t smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug-like it's your last one. 

If you read all of it, until tomorrow my friend :) 
have a good day and a great year.
Not mine but u can spread it :)"

Sorry if it's too long"

"I loved him since I was 12 and now I'm 18.
And,now he is in relationship.
I treated him like a bigger.I cared him like a nurse.I loved him as his parents love him.
I understanded him everything he did.
But ,he chose another girl.She is 4years younger than him.
I cried the whole night.
I can't stop my feeling 😭"
I just want to feel okay again
"This playlist is a masterpiece ♥ I hope everyone found happiness and heatlh to live the life, maybe is hard but beautiful."
The worst feeling in the word is being unwanted/unappreciated by your partner.
Love tore me up 💔

"respect your pillows because it's the one who catch your tears. 
Respect your  beds because it's the one who let u relax.
Respect your phone because it's the one who helps your escape reality.
Respect your stuffed animals because it's the one who gives you hugs.
respect your blanket because it's the one who keeps you warm. Respect your mirror.... because it's doesn't laugh when u cry. respect your pillows because it's the one who catch your tears. 
Respect your  beds because it's the one who let u relax.
Respect your phone because it's the one who helps your escape reality.

"Sometimes it's not bad to give up and i guess i already had enough, and can't take it anymore better to take a rest forever"
I just came here to cry more 💔
"My mirror doesn't laugh at me. My pillow will catch my tears when nobody will. My online friends will never hurt me. My stuffed animals will always cuddle with me. My blanket will always keep me warm. My phone will never make fun of me. Music will always understand me more then anyone. My legs will keep me standing when I don't feel strong enough. My body will never judge me or make me feel bad. My baby doll will always listen to what I have to say and won't interupt me. 
All I ask for is really friends who will never leave me or hurt me but that's a dream and it might not happen maybe it will I just have to wait and find out and I'm sorry for anyone going through the same thing as me right now and I wish I could help if I couldn't would so please don't be so hard on yourselfs just love yourself and try to stay out of drama don't make the mistake as me please.
 Don't beat your pillow up out of anger don't hurt your self over somebody who hurt you. Don't break your mirror because you feel ugly just try to love yourself more I'm sure things will get better after  a while just try to focus on work or school and stay out of drama it will help a lot 
Parents think we are being lazy rude we have an additude all the time we always hide in our room we never want to do anything we never want to be at home we never hang out with them we just make problems we are over dramatic we never focus on school we cause to much drama we hurt ourself for attention we just want all the attention we always lie we never go outside we just cause trouble we are just going through a phase we just cry for attention we don't want them going through our phone because we are hiding something we try to fail school we purposely don't pay attention in class
PARENTS NEED TO GET WE WILL NEVER BE PERFECT STOP HURTING YOUR SELF OVER YOU PARENTS
To who ever is reading this I hope you are ok and just know that I love you and things will get better soon"
"its hard when she said ""we just friend"" :("
When you want to cry but can't because there's no tears left

"I've cried so much that I no longer have tears, I've faked so many smiles that I no longer have a real one, and endured so much pain that I feel broken, I'm afraid to die but I don't want to suffer anymore"
Today my friend told my crush i like him and then he asked me if it was true so i ran away then later he looked at me and smiled
"Dad your always in our families and relatives thought,..
 Miss you Dad."

"My shower doesn't make fun of my body
My pillow hold my tears
My mirror never laughs when I'm crying
My mind keeps secrets
My bed holds me

scared to die, but tired of breathing

Honestly at this point I listen to things like this while laying in bed and thinking about things like the fact 
that all the people who claim to be my friends are never there for me and how my own family doesn’t seem to care 
about me and how I can’t even find love no matter what I do and I can’t even cry when I listen to this it’s like if
 I’m just an empty shell with nothing left inside

“Life isn’t fun without a struggle in it, but some struggles lead to tragic endings.”

Whats funny is that I act all happy around my friends and at night I just break down.. I miss the old days, I didn't fake smiles..

“Dont cry because they are gone, smile because they were here.”

""You don't want to end your life. You just want to get rid of the pain inside you.""

""Why are you always so quiet?""
""Because no one is ever listening to me anyway.""

When someone who makes you feel better good and happy passes away far from you and all you have good memories that the only thing you have

""You're fading away, and it's all their fault.""

""There are moment when I wish I could roll back the clock and take away all the sadness away ,But I have the feeling that if I did , The joy would be gone as well "" .

""Now I don't cry out loud , I just suffer in silence . ""

You had only seen my smile , you never know how much pain I'm carrying inside the smile :)

""When you love them you need to let them GO""

Smile is a mask
Laugh is a cover
Sleep is an escape
Life is hell"
"Keep moving and standing up tall no one can make ur life miserable when u stand up tall and have courage my grandmother past away on February 2021 still I’m standing up tall

I cry silently i can't handle my mix emotions when he said
 were friend!
Im still rooting for my first love 
To comeback 😭. And I'm not the person he is rooting for...
It hurt so bad when the person you like and always care for is not meant for you.
Yeah😔the word 
We're meant to be just not made to last exist 💔.
But I'm happy that he tells me honestly and never hide a secret,
😘❤️❤️❤️
Sorry my grammar is not that good 🙁
I'm still in the healing process.....
And after all he deserve me 
And all my efforts will forever worth it my mind and ingrave in his heart 😭 who knows maybe in another place and time maybe in another life
Forever grateful in case you were mine?
I will take you for granted ... Always😢😞
 
Thank you! for making me happy and feel complete when your around even in a short period of time 😔😁
I will comeback in this comment when Im completely healed."

"EH, TÚ! Sí, tú, sentado detrás de tu pantalla leyendo esto. No te conozco y ciertamente no me conoces a mí. Pero quiero decirte algo. Todos tienen su propia historia. La tuya puede estar llena de alegría y felicidad, o puede estar nublada por el dolor y la desgracia. Quiero que sepas que eres una persona hermosa, maravillosa y talentosa. Incluso si tu vida no va como quieres en este momento, sé que podrás salir bien. Quiero que me hagas un favor. Sé que solo soy un extraño, pero confía en mí, ¿de acuerdo? Cada vez que veas tu reflejo, ya sea en el espejo del baño, en una ventana en algún lugar o en un charco en la calle, quiero que te mires y te des un abrazo. Porque aunque no seas la más guapa, ni la más inteligente ni la más divertida, eres algo que nadie más puede ser: tú. Y eres lo mejor que puedes ser. Sonríe a los extraños. Ten confianza en ti mismo. Llora cuando tengas ganas de llorar, ríe cuando tengas ganas de reír. Trátese como un dios / diosa porque se lo merece. Mantén la cabeza erguida y el corazón abierto. Lo vales todo y algo más. Y recuerda siempre que pase lo que pase, aunque no lo parezca, eres todo para alguien

"i tought i have no tears left, but when i am by myself and unexpected sad songs encounter on fb my tears just come out..i hate it so i intendedly search for sad songs in here to get some ""immunity""..tears just pour down like rain..
maybe i should not let my tears dry, so i can hold on to this feeling of how important she is in my life.."
"At morning : Smile, positive, happy and strong..
At night : Cry, negative, mad and sad and weak.."
I listen to these songs to make me cry cause I can’t hold it in anymore but I have been hurt played with and pushed around so much I can’t cry anymore and it hurts more then when you cry cause you put on a fake smile every day and pretend to be someone your not and it hurts you more then anything
"Depression is the most painful in this world ever…
We just want less pain, we don’t need happiness, is it really that hard…
My boyfriend broke up with me, my grandpa passed away, my classmate hate me, everything just happened at the same time. And I don’t even have a time to cry… And everyone just like I should be pretending I’m ok, no one care my feelings… 
What I can do is listen to sad songs, look at the sky, think about my grandpa, think about my ex, and cry. And then the next morning, I started pretending ok again and again.
Anyways I believe I will cross over this hard time, but I really need some to recover.
Hopefully whoever see this comment will know you are not the only one! You are not alone! I’m here will you!"
I don't have a love life but why am i crying 🤧😆😆
I believe the last I cried was when I was talking about me being bullied at school thinking about it now I feel kinda stupid for crying in front of my mother

I'm a known to be a strong and happy person with a good heart and for a fact I know that I'm a big softie. yet I'm a person who's got backstabbed and hurt by my most trusted people over and over again. like they would use me to the max and then just go away.. leaving me alone.. and I finally found myself someone to call mine. and I love him with all my spirit. he was the saviour of me when I was in a desperate times. but he never wanted the world to know that we were dating. he just wanted to be super secret. and I allowed it cause I can't lose him too..and in the end someone got the word of us . merely a rumour and we fought..he told me we never dated...it was just something I made up in my mind.. even though we were dating for 2 years... and he told me I was just an attention seeker... and made me the bad person at the end with his words... and I'm in a place that I don't know what's actually wrong with me.. I don't know what's so bad about me that people hates so much to be friends with me... I never did anything that hurt anyone.. I'm not even one of those complicated girls who demands for so much.. I'm just at a point that I'm slowly letting my self love slip through my fingers... I'm showing the world I am not affected... but I'm broken.. I'm hurt..and in verge of giving up...😔 and I can't even tell anyone I'm hurting so much if the word of me dating him would get out... 😔 please..I hope I can hold on.. I don't wanna go...😔😔😔

And when you walk away from them they aren't bothered at all, they just ignore you like you never existed at all.. 💔💔 the more painful thing is you still care for them and you still think they will change one day and come back to you even after knowing that out there they are enjoying their time with someone else. 💔💔"

My heart hurts but for some reason I can't cry so l read and watch sad things that will make me cry
If you cry it doesn't mean your weak. It's just proves how much a human needs something once in a while to release their utmost sadness. Like an escape rope to life even while crying it didn't felt weird or something but instead it's comforting.
"I have never opened up before because I always felt alone.. I fell in love with this guy, he’s truly amazing in every way but the thing is that he doesn’t like me but likes someone else, I cry myself to sleep and face so many anxiety attacks because of this, I tried to move on multiple times but it doesn’t seem to work, I’m so attached to him.. I don’t know what to do because I’ve never fallen in love with someone this deeply and I’m afraid I won’t be able to move on.."

"The past 3yrs have been so hard and it seems its just getting harder..
I wish i was dumb and that i never had a thought in my mind, just blank.. Sometimes i wish i could just be numb, i dont wanna die but i feel so broken, im trying so hard to stop myself  from overthinking and i cant..
People around me are getting annoyed by how stressed i am and how much i digg up my past, i also hate myself for it, i wish i was normal I WISH I WAS FCKING DUMB AND NEVER HAD A SINGLE TRAUMA IN MY LIFE
but hey, wtf can i do bout it.. I was born and life fcked me over.. I just hope it will heal and get easyer with time cause i really cant anymore.. I just wanna feel normal and happy
For everyone else going through anything, im so sorry but time will do its thing no matter how hard it is to wait.. I love you all, stay strong ❤️"

That is all gone, I just sit on my bed hoping for us to meet again, or start over but today, it's not gonna happen, now before you guys think I'm being dramatic he made me smile, happy, he even held on to meet me when I was born, that ment alot to me, my bff and I got drifted, my parents fight time to time alot, my online friend and I are ex-friends, all this hurts, I just want my past back, if I could go back in the past I would, I honestly would in a heartbeat but, I cant, the past is the past, losing someone you love really hurts, no one understands

"Hey, you, yes, I am talking right to you. I hope you will see yourself with the eyes I see you one day, because I can tell you have some awesome music taste :) You’re such a beautiful human being and worth and enough. I hope you know that you do only need yourself to be happy, I know society build up the standard that whenever you’re alone you’re not living a happy live. But in fact that is not true, if you start to realize that you actually deserve all the good things happening to you, you will treat yourself a lot  nicer. I hope you let yourself rest, don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes, over regret, and over everything your mind wants to destroy you. I wish I could remove all those demons inside of your head because you deserve to feel happy. If you ever feel lonely then watch the sky, because you know, someone, at the same time is watching the sky too, maybe feeling the same way..I am glad you exist and I hope you won’t ever remove your own spot in this world, maybe you don’t feel like you belong here but, Angel, then build your home here. I don’t want you to leave this world unhappy. I want you to live every little second, I want you to feel alive, I don’t want you to see yourself just existing. You deserve it. Whatever happened, it’s not your fault, the demons in your head recognize that you have a beautiful heart, they want to take it because they have never seen such beautiful heart as yours, so why let them win over you? . You’re not selfish for isolating yourself, but you deserve to talk to someone. If you’re reading this than please never forget to breath and smile. 
Don’t live up to other standards! It’s your story and not theirs. 
Life for those who couldn’t, smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug like its your last one. 
I love you and send you hugs.
You’re so strong, you’re still here, and I am proud of you. 
YOU ARE NOT USELESS. READ THAT AGAIN. 
YOU ARE WORTH IT. READ THAT AGAIN.
YOU ARE LOVED. READ THAT AGAIN.
I AM GLAD YOU EXIST. READ THAT AGAIN.
YOU ARE NOT A PROBLEM. YOU ARE HUMAN AND YOUR FEELINGS ARE VALID. READ THAT AGAIN.
YOU ARE NOT BEING DRAMATIC. 
You’re not a burden to anyone, don’t be afraid to talk, to use your voice. 
You’re beautiful inside out. Your body is beautiful the way it is. 
Please don’t starve yourself. Please eat, I know it’s hard but you deserve food. You deserve to eat and drink. 
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. READ THAT AGAIN.
I WISH I COULD HUGH YOU RIGHT NOW, SO A VIRTUAL HUG WILL DO. 
It hurts me to see you’re in pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you. 
I love u I love u I love u I love u I love u please don’t go.
I am sorry that no one is hearing you, I am sorry no one is noticing that you have lost yourself. I wish I could take your pain away, it hurts me to see the pain in your eyes.  I love you trough my words and I mean it. I just want you to stay, hold on a little longer okay? Please? For me.??
I hope you have an awesome day/ morning/ evening/ night. 
If it’s night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. 
If it’s day for you, don’t start it by such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water in the morning and so on.. You will start building little healthy habits. 
If it’s evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed.
And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re stronger than you think, I know you will make it :) 
Now wipe those tears away and smile for me, you really don’t know much a smile can brighten someone’s day, do you? I hope one day yours will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore, because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.
Remember crying is not weakness, let it out as much as you can but don’t let the emotion control you by giving up. It’s okay, you’re here, you’re safe, you can let it out.
Did anyone asked you, how you are feeling today? If not, how are you really? I don’t think you’re doing good, but you will feel good at one point. Don’t give yourself up. 
I am sorry you feel misunderstood.
But anyone who gets to be with you, doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they is :).
Enough with beating up yourself for today, okay?!
- The stranger that cares about you more than anything.
I hope this is enough for you to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. I hope you can stay.
This is your sign to stay and treat yourself with love, you deserve it.
And in case no one told you today, again, I am so proud of you. 
I hope you will remember my words :)
Until tomorrow, my friend :)"
I cant cry anymore.

"""Knowing you, you could've saved yourself but instead you chose to end it because you've suffered too much."" The women said while standing right In front of her brothers grave, tears running down her face as she cried silently afraid of people judging her for crying too loudly as she was raised in a very strict family which she needs to act lady-like.
""Forgive me brother, for not having enough courage to help you and comfort you"" she added.. she continued crying ""but its already too late.. if I could turn back time I would do anything to save and protect you, dear brother"" she continued now ignoring the peoples judging eyes as screamed, she screamed whilst kneeling down grasping her clothes near her heart. Her parents and relatives were now scolding her telling her that she was a disappointment but she didn't care anymore as the only person that cared and helped her left this world on his own.. it was sad but what could she do- die? No no thats not the answer ""Knowing my brother, he wouldn't let me and would cry in my stead instead"" the poor girl whispered to herself.. now that she's alone she needs to toughen herself up as there was no one on her side. She now knows the harsh reality."
this is where sad ppl jams
"Came into the comments fully prepared to unleash all of my sorrow/distress/deep deep deep sadness. 
But somehow, reading these sad comments and seeing all of you guys going through tough times really made me realize that I’m by no means alone, and it comforted me so much you have no idea. 
So to all of you guys who wrote that comment saying how hurt you were, thank you. It helped me in a way you cannot even imagine.
And to all the others, do know that you too are not alone. It might be tough to picture it right now but eventually it will be okay friend, you’ll get through it.
♥️♥️♥️"

It's not that I'm suicidal; It's just that there hasn't been a single day that I have felt grateful for being alive.
